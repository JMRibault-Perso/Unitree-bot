# G1 Teaching Protocol - Command Reference (Deprecated)

This document previously listed packet-level command IDs. Those details are not
part of the confirmed sources and should not be used.

Use these confirmed sources instead:

- Phone logs (WebRTC JSON over `rt/api/arm/request`): API IDs 7107, 7108, 7109,
  7110, 7113.
- Unitree Arm Action Service (SDK, EDU models): `ExecuteAction(action_id)`,
  `ExecuteAction(action_name)`, `StopCustomAction()`, `GetActionList()`.

If new, reproducible evidence is collected, create a new reference with sources
and test steps.
