# APK API Discoveries (Deprecated)

This document previously contained APK decompilation findings. Per the project
rule, only SDK documentation and phone logs are considered authoritative for
G1 Air API access.

Use these instead:
- PROTOCOLS_FROM_PHONE_LOGS.md
- TEACH_MODE_REFERENCE.md
- Unitree Arm Action Service (SDK, EDU models)
