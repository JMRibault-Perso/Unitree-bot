# Real Packet Examples (Deprecated)

This file is intentionally blanked. Prior packet-level analysis is not part of the
confirmed sources and should not be used.

Authoritative sources for teach mode behavior:

- Phone logs (WebRTC JSON over `rt/api/arm/request`): API IDs 7107, 7108, 7109,
  7110, 7113.
- Unitree Arm Action Service (SDK, EDU models): `ExecuteAction(action_id)`,
  `ExecuteAction(action_name)`, `StopCustomAction()`, `GetActionList()`.

If new evidence is collected, create a new document with sources and test steps.
