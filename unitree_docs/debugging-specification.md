You can use your own PC (**Ubuntu**) to establish communication between the User PC and G1 by connecting it to the Ethernet port on the shoulder of the G1. Your program can be deployed either on your own PC or on the secondary development board that comes with the G1 to control G1 movement over the DDS network.

Step 1: Secure the G1 robot to the protective bracket, ensuring that the four omnidirectional wheels on the bottom of the bracket are locked in place.

Step 2: The User PC can debug the communication with the RJ45 port of the device through the Ethernet cable. See the introduction of electrical interfaces in the ["About G1"](https://support.unitree.com/home/en/G1_developer/about_G1) section.
