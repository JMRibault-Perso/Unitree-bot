Warm Tips for the Development and Use of Unitree Humanoid Robots

Due to the preference of the general public for movements that are closer to and more natural like those of real humans, we kindly request everyone to pay attention to the following guidelines, especially when shooting videos of the humanoid robots:

  1. In the development of leg movement programs, strive to make the knee joints upright or close to an upright position.

  2. Minimize step frequency and try to avoid stepping in place as much as possible.

  3. Keep the feet slightly close together and try to avoid spreading them apart while walking.




We hope the above information is helpful to you.
