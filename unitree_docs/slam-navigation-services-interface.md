# SLAM navigation service interface

## 1\. Introduction

The interface of SLAM and navigation service is based on unitree sdk2 for interface calling. Before using, please ensure that you are in the same LAN segment as the robot, and confirm that the unitree_slam and lidar_driver services of G1 are turned on through the App. When using the interface calling, please do not use the navigation function on the App at the same time. The client can realize basic SLAM and navigation functions by configuring different api-ids and subscribing to different topic data.

The origin of the coordinate system of the point cloud and positioning information output by slam is the origin of the Mid360-IMU coordinate system. The positive direction of the X axis is directly in front of the robot, and the positive direction of the Z axis is vertically upward. For details of the Mid360 coordinate system, please refer to the LIDAR service interface.

Applicable scenarios and scope: `static indoor flat scenes` with `rich features` and `X-axis/Y-axis of less than 45m`. (Large-scale maps take up more computing resources. In order not to affect basic operation and control services, please do not exceed the recommended range.) Violent movements may cause loss of positioning, please avoid violent movements of the robot when using this interface.

This function is suitable for the education and scientific research industries and is not recommended for industrial applications. Please contact sales for industrial applications.

Note: Before use, please check for any abnormalities in the raw lidar point clouds and IMU data before use, and the head is fixed vertically upward without looseness. If the front and rear point cloud data frames are obviously stratified when the lidar illuminates the same static vertical plane in a static state, or the IMU linear velocity and acceleration values are significantly abnormal, please contact sales for lidar repair.  
The point clouds data topic name is:rt/utlidar/cloud_livox_mid360  
The imu data topic name is:rt/utlidar/imu_livox_mid360

## 2\. Network configuration

The default IP address of the NX development board is 192.168.123.164. Users can access the local area network through a direct network cable. The lidar IP address used in this service is: 192.168.123.120. Please make sure that the lidar IP address is correct before use. The network check steps are as follows:

  1. After the user's PC is directly connected to the G1 internal switch via an Ethernet cable, change the local IP address to 192.168.123.XXX (the XXX setting value should not conflict with the existing IP).

  2. Open the terminal and enter the following commands to check whether the communication is successfully connected.


    
    
    ssh unitree@192.168.123.164 # Enter the NX , the initial password is: 123
    
    ping 192.168.123.120 #Lidar IP address
    
    ping 192.168.123.161 #PC1 IP address

## 3\. Service Data Description

        }
    }
    
    feedback data:
    {
        "succeed":true, #Whether the execution was successful or not
        "errorCode":0,  #Error code, 0 means normal
        "info":"",      #Description information
        "data":{}       #Rest of data
    }

2.end mapping
    
    
    api id: 1802
    
    input parameters:
    {
      "data": {
          "address": "/home/unitree/test.pcd" #Pcd save address
        }
    }
    
    feedback data:

`Note`：  
To prevent multiple pcd map files from occupying too much disk space, it is recommended to unify the file names as `test1.pcd~test10.pcd`, overwrite the saved map pcd data.
