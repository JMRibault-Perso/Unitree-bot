Unitree humanoid robot development and use of warm tips:

Since the general public prefer to move more closely and naturally, the following attention to the use of humanoid robots, especially when shooting robot video:

  1. Developed leg movement procedures to bring the knee to upright or upright as far as possible;
  2. Reduce the stride frequency as much as possible, and avoid standing still as far as possible;
  3. Keep your feet slightly closer, and avoid leaving your feet away as much as possible when walking;



we hope the above content will help you.

Important Note on Video Crediting Suggestions

**Dear Developer,  
We recommend that when publishing your research outcomes in video format, you add the name or logo (Logo) of your laboratory in a prominent position throughout the video. This will prevent confusion about the actual source of the video as it circulates among the general public. Thank you for your support of Unitree Technology.**

# Part name

G1 whole machine is divided into upper body and lower body, with multiple degrees of freedom. A single arm has five degrees of freedom, including the shoulder, upper arm, and elbow joints. One leg has six degrees of freedom, including the hip, leg, hip, knee, and ankle joints. The waist has 1 degree of freedom, namely the lumbar joint. According to different versions, the whole machine can be divided into G1 basic version (23 degrees of freedom), G1-EDU version (23~43 degrees of freedom), by multiple joint motor degrees of freedom, so that the robot can achieve accurate motion and attitude control.

Dexterous Hand Usage Tips 

When using the dexterous hand, always ensure that the robot's movements do not cause interference between the hand and the main body. You can add some outward offset to the shoulder motors to avoid collisions between the dexterous hand and the body. During development, it is not recommended to perform overly intense actions, such as running or balance tests, while the dexterous hand is attached.

## Installation hole position: unit: mm

If you need to use the G1 mounting hole, please remove the label on the hole first.

## Electrical Interface

The right side of the G1 is equipped with electrical interfaces, which are used to connect the various body joint motors, sensor peripherals, network ports, etc. This design makes it easy to debug, troubleshoot problems, and do secondary development.

## Joint motor

The G1 joint adopts Unitree self-developed motor, which has excellent performance and characteristics. The maximum torque of the motor is 120N.m, and the design of the hollow axis makes the motor more lightweight and compact in structure. The motor is also equipped with dual encoders to provide more accurate position and velocity feedback to meet the needs of high precision control.
