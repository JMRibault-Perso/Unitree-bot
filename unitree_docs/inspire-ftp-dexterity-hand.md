# Introduction to the Dexterous Hand SDK

The G1 can be equipped with the humanoid five-finger dexterous hand from [Inspire Robotics](https://inspire-robots.com/product/frwz/). This dexterous hand features 6 degrees of freedom and 12 motion joints, allowing it to simulate complex human hand movements. The tactile version of this hand integrates 17 tactile sensors.

## Control Methods

The dexterous hand offers two communication methods: Modbus RTU via RS-485 and Modbus TCP. For models without tactile sensors, only RS-485 is supported. This SDK supports both of the aforementioned methods for communication with the dexterous hand, forwarding data and control commands in DDS format.

The G1 provides a USB-to-serial module, allowing users to connect this USB module to the G1 development unit (PC2) for RS-485 communication control. The port is typically set to /dev/ttyUSB0 in this case, and you will need to run the program with the suffix 485.

  1. **Controlling with Inspire Official SDK**

Users can write their own programs to control the dexterous hand according to the Inspire dexterous hand official communication protocol.

  2. **Controlling with Unitree Dexterous Hand SDK**

The G1 communication is based on the DDS framework. To facilitate the use of `unitree_sdk2` for controlling the dexterous hand, Unitree provides example programs that convert dexterous hand data into DDS messages.




## SDK Interface Description

Users can send `"inspire::inspire_hand_ctrl"` messages to the topic `"rt/inspire_hand/ctrl/*"` to control the dexterous hand.  
Messages of type `"inspire::inspire_hand_state"` can be received from the topic `"rt/inspire_hand/state/*"` to obtain the status of the dexterous hand.  
Messages of type `"inspire::inspire_hand_touch"` can be received from the topic `"rt/inspire_hand/touch/*"` to obtain tactile sensor data.  
Here, `*` is the topic suffix, which defaults to `r`, indicating the right hand.

When using 485 communication, the `"rt/inspire_hand/touch/*"` topic will not publish any messages.

rt/inspire_hand/state/*

## IDL Data Format

Motor data is organized in array format, containing data from the 12 motors of both hands. The specific formats for `MotorCmd_.idl` and `MotorState_.idl` can be found in the [Basic Services Interface](https://support.unitree.com/home/en/G1_developer/basic_services_interface).

The dexterous hand data format is largely consistent with the official description document from Inspire. For more details, refer to the `.idl` files in `inspire_hand_sdk/hand_idl`.

        };
    };

note

Control messages have added a mode option, which allows for the combination of control commands implemented in binary to specify the execution of instructions.
    
    
    - mode 0: 0000 (no operation)
    - mode 1: 0001 (angle)
    - mode 2: 0010 (position)
    - mode 3: 0011 (angle + position)
    - mode 4: 0100 (force control)
    - mode 5: 0101 (angle + force control)
    - mode 6: 0110 (position + force control)
    - mode 7: 0111 (angle + position + force control)
    - mode 8: 1000 (speed)
    - mode 9: 1001 (angle + speed)
    - mode 10: 1010 (position + speed)
    - mode 11: 1011 (angle + position + speed)
    - mode 12: 1100 (force control + speed)
    - mode 13: 1101 (angle + force control + speed)
    - mode 14: 1110 (position + force control + speed)
    - mode 15: 1111 (angle + position + force control + speed)

# SDK Installation and Usage

This SDK is primarily implemented in Python and relies on [`unitree_sdk2_python`](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_sdk2_python), while also utilizing PyQt5 and PyQtGraph for visualization.

## Install Dependencies

  1. clone the SDK working directory:
    
        git clone https://github.com/NaCl-1374/inspire_hand_ws.git

  2. Update submodules:
    
        git submodule init  # Initialize submodules
    git submodule update  # Update submodules to the latest version

  3. Install [unitree_sdk2_python](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_sdk2_python):
    
        cd unitree_sdk2_python
    pip install -e .

note

ref: [unitree_sdk2_python](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_sdk2_python)，Install the required dependencies, and proceed with subsequent operations after the unitree_sdk2_python test passes.

  4. Install inspire_hand_sdk
    
        cd ../inspire_hand_sdk
    pip install -e .




If error when `pip3 install -e .` ref: [unitree_sdk2_python](https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_sdk2_python),This error mentions that the cyclonedds path could not be found. First compile and install cyclonedds:

## Usage

### Dexterous Hand and Environment Configuration

First, configure the network for the device. The default IP for the is:left hand is `192.168.123.210`,right hand is `192.168.123.211`. The device running the driver must be on the same subnet as the dexterous hand. After configuration, execute `ping 192.168.123.210` or `ping 192.168.123.211` to check if communication is normal.

If you need to adjust the IP of the dexterous hand and other parameters, you can run the **Dexterous Hand Configuration Panel** in the usage example below. The panel will automatically read the device information in the current network. After modifying the parameters on the panel, you need to click `Write Settings` to send the parameters to the dexterous hand. The parameters will not take effect until you click `Save Settings` and restart Hand.

For configuration using RS-485 communication, the method is similar to TCP, allowing you to modify the device ID through the configuration panel. However, due to the limited bandwidth of RS-485, only one device can run on a bus at about 20 Hz, so usually only the port number needs to be changed.

note

To grant serial port access to a user in Ubuntu, you can add the user to the `dialout` group, which has permissions for serial devices (e.g., `/dev/ttyS0` or `/dev/ttyUSB0`). Here’s how:

  1. **Check if the user is already in the`dialout` group**:
    
        groups $USER

  2. **Add the user to the`dialout` group** (replace `your_username` with the actual username):
    
        sudo usermod -aG dialout your_username

  3. **Log out and back in** (or reboot) to apply the new permissions.

  4. **Verify the permissions** : You can check the device permissions with:
    
        ls -l /dev/ttyUSB0




After these steps, the user should have access to serial devices.

note

If you modify the IP, you need to change the following code in the relevant files to update the `ip` option to the new IP address. It is recommended to change it to the same `192.168.123.***` subnet as `unitree_sdk2`.
    
    
    # inspire_hand_sdk/example/Vision_driver.py and inspire_hand_sdk/example/Headless_driver.py
    handler=inspire_sdk.ModbusDataHandler(ip=inspire_hand_defaut.defaut_ip, LR='r', device_id=1)          
    
    # inspire_hand_sdk/example/init_set_inspire_hand.py
    window = MainWindow(ip=defaut_ip)

Here, the `LR` option is the parameter for the DDS message suffix `*`, which can be defined according to the device.

When running, be sure to modify the DDS working network card option; for details, refer to the [G1 SDK Quick Development](https://support.unitree.com/home/en/G1_developer/quick_development) for DDS configuration.

The main communication interface definitions of the SDK are as follows: please configure according to the instructions.
