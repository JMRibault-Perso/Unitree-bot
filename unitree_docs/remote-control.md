# Concept description

Concept | Description  
---|---  
Zero Torque Mode | All motors of the robot stop active motion, and there is no damping feeling when swinging.  
Damping Mode | All motors of the robot stop active motion, and there is a clear damping feeling when swinging, which can enter the ready mode.  
Ready Mode | The robot will slowly swing out the preparatory posture before the motion mode within 5 seconds.  
Squat mode  |  The robot will slowly enter a squat position within 5 seconds (no balance control)   
Seating mode  |  The robot will slowly assume a seated position within 5 seconds (no balance control)   
Motion Mode | A mode in which the robot can be controlled to move by a remote control.  
Continuous Walking Mode | The robot is always in a stepping state.  
Standing Mode | In this mode, when the joystick instruction is zero, the robot stops stepping and enters the standing state; when the joystick instruction is not zero, or the robot is disturbed and difficult to maintain balance, the robot will start to take steps.  
Debug Mode | For low-level development:When using the SDK for development or debugging, always verify that G1 is in debug mode (damping or zero-torque). Enter debug mode by pressing L2 + R2 on the remote); this halts the motion-control program and prevents potential command conflicts. To confirm debug mode is active, press L2 + A. In an emergency during debugging, press L2 + B on the remote to switch the device to damping mode.  
  
> The robot's current walking mode does not include the function for climbing stairs. Please avoid having the robot climb stairs at will to prevent damage to the robot.

note

  1. After switching back to the **Squatting position** through **L2 + A** from the **Main Operation Control** , if you want to switch back to the **Main Operation Control** mode without shutting down the device, you need to enter the damping mode through **L2 + B** , and then switch back to the **Main Operation Control** through **L2 + A**.

  2. The equipment department only supports entering the debugging mode by pressing L2+R2 under zero torque or damping.

  3. When in the standing position, certain button combinations need to be `held for two seconds` to take effect.

  4. **L2 + B** Damping button, serving as an emergency stop button, remains effective even in debug mode, effectively preventing robot state runaway.`

note

  1. Starting in lying position and starting in squatting position is only suitable for flat and hard ground. There is a risk of standing instability in other scenes. Please do not try it at will.
  2. Equipped with dexterous hand equipment, please be careful to start the device in the lying or squatting position, which may cause damage to the dexterous hand.
