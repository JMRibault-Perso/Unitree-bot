## SDK Introduction

`unitree_ sdk2` is an SDK developed by Unitree Technology for the new generation of robots. The SDK encapsulates interfaces such as basic motor control and high motion control, and provides relevant function interfaces. You can follow the interfaces and routines we provide, along with the 《G1 SDK Development Guide》, to learn robot control and complete the secondary development of G1.
