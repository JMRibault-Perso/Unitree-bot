# BrainCo Hand Service

The G1 can be equipped with BrainCo's [2nd generation Dexterous Hand](https://www.brainco-hz.com/docs/revolimb-hand/product/overview.html), which features 6 degrees of freedom.

The dexterous hand is controlled via serial communication, and the manufacturer provides C and Python SDKs.

In this repository, we convert serial messages into DDS messages so they can be used with unitree_sdk2.

  * Each hand (left or right) is controlled by a USB-to-serial device, and each generates a pair of topics: rt/brainco/(left or right)/(cmd or state).

  * The position and speed of the fingers are normalized to the [0, 1] range.

  * It is recommended to set the speed of all fingers to 1.0.

  * The finger indices are mapped as follows: [Thumb, Thumb_aux, Index, Middle, Ring, Pinky].
