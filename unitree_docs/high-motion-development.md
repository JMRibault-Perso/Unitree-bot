High-level motion development refers to the process of developing based on the high-level interfaces of the Unitree control system.

In high-level motion development, developers utilize the built-in motion planning algorithms and behavior control framework to design and implement complex motion tasks and behaviors for the robot. High-level motion development often focuses on the development of intelligent behaviors and advanced functionalities of the robot, aiming to achieve more complex, flexible, and autonomous motion capabilities.
