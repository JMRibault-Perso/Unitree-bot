# Boot process

## Sitting upright and turning on the device

**Step1: Body placement**  
If conditions permit, G1 supports booting while sitting in a chair.First, ensure that the G1 is sitting on a chair with arms and legs placed naturally, as shown in the following image.

**Step2: Install the battery pack**

Insert the battery into the battery slot from the side of the fuselage, pay attention to the installation direction, do not force pressure, so as to avoid damage to the battery interface and clap, when you hear the "click ~" sound, the battery pack is installed.

**Step3: Successfully boot**

After short pressing and long pressing the power button to turn on the machine, wait for about 1 minute until G1 enters the zero torque state. Press L1 + A to enter the damping state. At this point, hold the G1 shoulder and press the L1+UP button to help G1 enter the ready state, as shown in the following figure.After G1 is straightened and standing, you can press **R1 + X(1 degree of freedom waist)** or **R1 + Y(3 degrees of freedom waist)** to enter the operation control state.

## Hanging and turning on

**Step1: Suspension G1**

Please use the protective rack to hang the G1 to ensure safety.

**Step3: Body placement**

After hanging G1, put it in its natural position.

**Step4: Power boot**

Short press the power switch key of the battery once, and then long press the power switch key for more than 2 seconds to power on the battery.

**Step5: Successful boot-up**

The whole boot process lasts for about 1 minute, please wait patiently. When the ankle hit the limit sound, the initialization is successful. Please wait another 30 seconds, press the remote control **L2 + B** to enter the damping to unlock the control, and then press **L2 + UP** to enter the preparatory state. The G1 posture is shown in the figure below.

**Step6: Down suspension rope**

After descending the suspension rope, the G1 feet touch the ground. Press the **R2 + A** of the remote control again, and then the control program starts, G1 enters the movement state from the preparatory state, G1 starts to adjust its gait and stand.

**Step7: Untie the suspension rope**

After the G1 movement is stabilized, the hook can be completely released. At this time, the left and right joystick control G1 movement.

Press **START** on the remote control to control the G1 to switch between standing and walking states.

Note:

**Emergency stop** : When G1 is in an unexpected state, press **L2 + B** and G1 goes into **damped mode** , which will losing balance and falling down.

# Debug mode

When G1 is suspended and damping, press the remote control **L2 + R2** combination, G1 enters debugging mode. Press **L2 + A** , G1 will enter the position mode and pose a specific diagnostic position.

Then press **L2 + B** , G1 to enter the damping state. This process can be used to confirm whether G1 has successfully entered debug mode, or for hardware troubleshooting. You can start developing and debugging with the SDK.

Note:

Under the current system version, once the G1 is turned on, the built-in motion control program will automatically start, even if you do not operate the remote control. The program periodically sends commands with a speed of 0. However, if you use the SDK in this state, you may cause conflicting instructions and thus cause G1 to jitter.

Therefore, when you need to use the SDK for development debugging, make sure that G1 is in debug mode to stop the motion control program from sending instructions, so as to avoid potential instruction conflict issues. You can press **L2+A** to confirm that you are in debug mode.

If the behavior after pressing **L2 + A** does not match with the teaching video, you can press **L2 + R2** several times to ensure entering the debugging mode.

# Shutdown process

## Sitting and turning off

Before shutting down, please control G1 to stand with its back facing in front of the chair, ensuring that the robot is in a stationary state. Hold the shoulder and handle with your hand, press **L1+LEFT** , and then help G1 sit down. After sitting down, press **L1+A** , G1 goes into **damped mode** again.

When the G1 is in damped mode, you can safely shut it down by pressing the extended battery on button.

## Hanging shutdown

Reconnect G1 to the hook, after the rope is pulling on G1, press **L2+B** , G1 goes into **damped mode** again.  
When the G1 is in damped mode, you can safely shut it down by pressing the extended battery on button, press **L2+R2** to enter debug mode, or press **L2 + UP** to re-enter ready mode.
