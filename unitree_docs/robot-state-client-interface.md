## RobotStateClient class

RobotStateClient is a client provided by the device state service. Through RobotClient, it is convenient to control the internal services of G1, obtain service status, device status, and system resource usage information through RPC (some functional interfaces are not yet open).

This interface is reused from the device status service interface of B2. You can find the relevant resources at the following location in the SDK.
